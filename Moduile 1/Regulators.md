### What is the stock market
The stock market is the place where participants go to transact stocks i.e. buy or sell stocks. The stock market is not a physical place.

### Market participants
Anyone who transacts in the stock market is a market participant. So both, companies whose stocks are **on** the market and individuals like me buying them are market participants; along with other players who I am not aware of now.

There are a few different kinds of market participants:
1. **Domestic retail participants**: Everyday people living in India. Aka Me.
2. **NRIs and OCI**: People of Indian origin who are not living in India.
3. **Domestic Institutions**: Companies based in India.
4. **Domestic Asset Management Companies**: Indian based companies that typically include mutual fund companies like SBI Mutual Fund.
5. **Foreigh Institutional Investors**: Foreign investors interested in the Indian market.

### Regulators
With all the above participants and more, there is a need to make sure that every participant follows a certain set of rules in order to make the market profitable for everyone.

**Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)** is the regulator for the Indian stock market. They ensure:
- The BSE and NSE conduct their business fairly
- Stock-brokers and subbrokers conduct their business fairly
- Participants do not get involved in unfair practices.
- Companies don't use the market to unduly benefit themselves.
- Small retail inverstors' interests are protected.
- Large investors with more cash do not manipulate the market.
- Overall development of the markets.

SEBI has a set of rules and regulations for quite a few entities that deal *directly* with the stock market. Of the entities, here are the ones that I find important:

Entity               | Description
---------------------|----------------------------------
**Debenture Trustees** | Almost all banks in India are debenture trustees. A debenture is a debt instrument with no collateral. Due to not having collateral, an entity issuing a debenture needs to rely on creditworthiness and  and reputation for support. Companies and govts often rely on debentures to raise capital funds. When companies want to raise a loan, they can issue debentures against which they promise to pay interest. The public can subscribe to these debentures. A Debenture Trustee ensures that a debenture keeps their word.
**Depositories  **     | Examples are NSDL and CSDL. They maintain the DEMAT accounts and act as a vault for the shares that you buy.
**Depository Participant**| Most of the banks and a few stockbrokers come under this. They act as an agent to the 2 depositories mentioned above. One cannot directly interact with the NSDL or CSDL. You need to have a liaison or close working communication with a DP to open an maintain a DEMAT account.
**Asset Mgmt Companies ** | They offer mutual fund schemes. Examples are HDFC AMC, Retail Capital etc. An AMC collects money from the public and puts it into a single account and then invests the money in the market aiming to grow and generate wealth.
**Portfolio Mgmt System** | PMSs are similar to mutual funds but they require a minimum investment of 25 lakh rupees.
**Stock brokers and subbrokers** | Act as an intermediary between investorand the stock exchange. If I want to buy or sell stocks on the stock exchange, I need to do it through a registered stock broker.
