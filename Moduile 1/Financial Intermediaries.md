From the time a person accesses the stock market to perform a transaction till the actions are reflected in their DEMAT account, there are multiple corporate entities making the entire process work from behind the scenes. These entitites are called the financial intermediaries.

All of the financial intermediaries strictly follow guidelines defined by SEBI.

There are 3 different financial intermediaries and all 3 of them are linked to an account of some sort.

### The Stock Broker
A stock broker is a corporate entity registered with the stock exchanges (NSE and BSE) as a trading member and holds a stockbroking license.

A stockbroker is the gateway to the stock market. In order to transact on the stock market, one would open a **trading account** with a stock broker.

A trading account lets a person carry out financial transactions on the stock market. A trading account is an account with the broker that lets an investor buy/sell securities.

There are multiple ways to interact with one's broker:
1. Personally visiting the broker's office and requesting the dealer to carry out your actions.
2. Calling the broker, identifying yourself with one's client code and requesting them to carry out the transactions.
3. DIY through a trading terminal provided by the broker.

###### Basic services provided by a stock broker
1. Give access to markets and letting a person transact.
2. Give the person margins for trading.
3. Provide support (dealing support in case of calls and software support in case of terminals)
4. Issue contract notes for the person's transactions. A contract note is a written confirmation detailing the transactions performed during the day.
5. Facilitate fund transfer between trading account and bank account.
6. Provide the person with a back office login so they (the person) can see a summary of their (the person's) account.
7. Charging brokerage.

### The Depository and the Depository Participant
When a person buys a share certificate, the only way they can claim their ownership is through a share certificate. A share certificate is a document entitling a person as an owner of shares in a company.

Since 1996, paper share certificates have been converted to a digital form and this process is called `dematerialization` or `DEMAT`.

A share certificate in DEMAT format needs to be store digitally. The storage place for a digital share certificate is called a DEMAT account.

A Depository is a financial intermediary that provides the service of a DEMAT account. A DEMAT account with a person's name will have all the shares owned by that person.

A broker's trading account an a depository's DEMAT account are linked.

Currently, there are 2 depositories offering DEMAT services: NSDL and CDSL.

In order to set up a DEMAT account with a Depository, you need to go via a Depository Participant. A DP acts as an agent to a Depository.

### The Bank
Banks help in facilitating funds tranfer from a person's bank account to their trading account. A person cannot transfer money from a bank account that is not in their name.

A person can link multiple bank accounts to their trading account in order to trade. Zerodha accpets one primary account and 2 secondary accounts. Funds can be added through any of the 3 bank accounts but withdrawals, divident payment, money from buybacks etc. will only happen to the primary account. 

The 3 financial intermediaries have their own accounts and all 3 accounts are operated electronically and are interlinked to give people seemless experience.
